# Risk-Modelling
# Overview:

This GitHub repository contains the Jupyter Notebook "Risk Modelling.ipynb," which explores advanced techniques in financial risk modeling. The project aims to develop and refine predictive models that can be used to assess various types of risks in the financial sector. By employing statistical and machine learning methods, this project seeks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of risk assessments in financial decision-making processes.

# Project Objectives:

    Develop Robust Risk Models: Utilize advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to create robust models that can accurately predict risk based on historical data.
    Risk Assessment: Analyze different types of financial risks, including credit risk, market risk, operational risk, and liquidity risk.
    Model Validation: Implement model validation techniques to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the risk models.
    Visualize Risk Metrics: Create visual representations of risk metrics to aid in the interpretation and communication of risk assessments to stakeholders.

# Key Features:

    Data Preprocessing: Includes techniques for cleaning and preparing data for modeling.
    Statistical Analysis: Leverages statistical methods to understand and quantify risk.
    Machine Learning Models: Applies various machine learning algorithms such as regression analysis, decision trees, and neural networks to predict financial risks.
    Performance Metrics: Evaluates models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
    Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for dynamic risk visualization.

# Technologies Used:

    Python: Primary programming language.
    Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding sessions and presentations.
    Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
    Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning models.
    Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
